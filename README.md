# CompSec_Proj2


can compare myshit.py with the benchmark to see where the numbers begin to differ(i.e. put print statements everywhere in each...) or something like that.

dont know if its worth it to spend the time on if we're doing a c++ implementation, might solve all our issues by just using unsigned ints, which python doesnt like(from my understanding). If the problem comes from how im converting original message into words and shit, then there could be some value gleemed from debugging the python.
